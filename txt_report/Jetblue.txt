Latest Sustainability Reporting Highlights

Over the past five years, JetBlue has achieved consistent reductions in Scope 1-3 emissions on an intensity basis, and improved 2.2 percent from 2018 to 2019.
2.6 billion pounds of CO2 emissions have been offset in partnership with Carbonfund.org since 2008.
Converted to electric ground service equipment (eGSE) at New Yorkâ€™s JFK Airport. This is projected to reduce four million pounds of CO2 greenhouse gas emission per year, reduce ground fuel usage by approx. 200,000 gallons fuel and create $500,000 in ground fuel savings annually
